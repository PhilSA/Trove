# Trove Utility AI

## Overview

Trove Utility AI provides a flexible and efficient decision-making system for ECS.

It is largely based on the "Infinite-Axis-Utility-System" (IAUS) approach by Dave Mark, which defines "Actions" that an AI agent can take, an "Considerations" that each Action uses to evaluate its score. An action is then selected based on score (highest score, weighted random, etc...), and the user is in charge of implementing the execution of that action.
