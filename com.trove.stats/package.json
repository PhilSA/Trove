  "description": "Trove Stats allows you to define identifiable \"numbers\" (Stats) on entities, and add/remove \"rules\" (Modifiers) that affect the evaluation of these numbers' values. Modifiers are reactive, and can make the value of a certain attribute depend on the value of another. This tool can be used to effortlessly setup gameplay mechanics such as RPG character/equipment attributes, buffs, effects, roguelike-style stackable powerups and synergies, etc...",
