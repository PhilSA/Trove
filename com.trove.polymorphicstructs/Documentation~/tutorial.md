# Tutorial

First, create an interface that will determine which "polymorphic methods" your structs will have. You must remember to put the `[PolymorphicStructInterface]` attribute on it:

```cs
[PolymorphicStructInterface]
public interface ITestPolymorphicStruct
{
    public bool DoSomething(ref TestData data);
}
```

In this example, `TestData` would be any struct containing data that the `DoSomething` method might want to operate on. Now, create structs that implement that interface and have the `[PolymorphicStruct]` attribute on them.

```cs
[PolymorphicStruct]
public struct TranslateForward : ITestPolymorphicStruct
{
    public float TranslationSpeed;

    public bool DoSomething(ref TestData data)
    {
        data.Position += math.forward() * TranslationSpeed * data.DeltaTime;
        return true;
    }
}

[PolymorphicStruct]
public struct Rotate : ITestPolymorphicStruct
{
    public float3 RotationSpeed;

    public bool DoSomething(ref TestData data)
    {
        data.Rotation = math.mul(RotationSpeed * data.DeltaTime, data.Rotation);
        return true;
    }
}

[PolymorphicStruct]
public struct ScaleUp : ITestPolymorphicStruct
{
    public Entity ScaleSpeedEntity;

    public bool DoSomething(ref TestData data)
    {
        if(data.ScaleSpeedLookup.TryGetComponent(ScaleSpeedEntity, out ScaleSpeed scaleSpeed))
        {
            data.Scale += scaleSpeed.Value * data.DeltaTime;
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

Now that we've written our 3 "child" structs that all do different things and all hold different data, a `PolyTestPolymorphicStruct` will automatically be generated by C# source generators. The generated struct takes the name of the polymorphic interface (`ITestPolymorphicStruct`), removes the "I" if present, and adds the "Poly" prefix. This `PolyTestPolymorphicStruct` will represent a union of the `TranslateForward`, `Rotate`, and `ScaleUp` structs, meaning it will contain a union of all the data that all of its child structs may contain.

With this new `PolyTestPolymorphicStruct` union struct, we can do things like this:

```cs
// Notice that "child" sctucts are implicitly casted to their "parent" type
PolyTestPolymorphicStruct translate = new TranslateForward { TranslationSpeed = 5f };
PolyTestPolymorphicStruct rotate = new Rotate { RotationSpeed = new float3(1f,1f,1f) };
PolyTestPolymorphicStruct scale = new ScaleUp { ScaleSpeedEntity = targetEntity };

// Add all structs to the same list
NativeList<PolyTestPolymorphicStruct> myList = new NativeList<PolyTestPolymorphicStruct>(Allocator.Temp);
myList.Add(translate);
myList.Add(rotate);
myList.Add(scale);

// Build our TestData
TestData myData = new TestData { // Here we'd fill our test data };

// Call DoSomething() on all elements of the list
for (int i = 0; i < myList.Length; i++)
{
    bool success = myList[i].DoSomething(ref testData);
}
```

With the ability to cast "child" structs to their "parent" structs, we can achieve polymorphic behaviours. When we iterate on `myList` and call `DoSomething()` on its elements, some elements will do a translation, some will do a rotation, and some will do scaling.

Note that "parent" structs can be casted to their "child" structs:

```cs
PolyTestPolymorphicStruct parent = new TranslateForward { TranslationSpeed = 5f };
TranslateForward child = parent;
```

However, if the "parent" struct was constructed with a different "child" type than the one we're casting to, the data the child will contain will be unpredictable. You can check which child type a parent struct was constructed with by checking the `CurrentTypeId` field of the generated parent struct.

Once you have a polymorphic struct, you can create a partial declaration of it in order to turn it into a component, make it implement interfaces, add attributes, etc...

```cs
// Turn our generated polymorphic struct into a dynamic buffer element, with internal capacity of zero 
[InternalBufferCapacity(0)]
public partial PolyTestPolymorphicStruct : IBufferElementData
{ }
```

Note that this package provides 3 different ways of generating or using polymorphic structs. This will be elaborated on in the [Polymorphic struct types](./poly-struct-types.md) section
