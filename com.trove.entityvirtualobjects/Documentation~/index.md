# Trove Entity Virtual Objects

Trove Entity Virtual Objects provides a way to create a world of virtual "objects" of any unamanged type that belongs to an entity. Objects can also include collection types, and nested collections are supported. Any objects belonging to the same Entity can safely read and write to each other in a parallel entity iteration job, since an objects world's memory is all backed by the same dynamic buffer.
